## Track 3 starter demo: robot simulation on AMD Radeon GPU

New to robotics, or want to learn how to run robot simulation on AMD GPUs? This reference demo is a quick, hands-on starting point for Track 3 participants — an end-to-end pipeline where a Franka Panda arm picks fruit off a table and places it in a bowl, built on the **Genesis** physics engine and **LeRobot**, running on an AMD Radeon (ROCm) GPU.

▶️ **Demo repo & videos:** https://github.com/wangxunx/franka_fruit_pick_demo

What you'll learn:
- Set up a robot simulation environment on an AMD Radeon GPU (ROCm), using the prebuilt ROCm PyTorch wheels
- Build a scene and run physics simulation with **Genesis**
- Record data, apply domain randomization, and train a visuomotor policy with **LeRobot**
- Go end-to-end — from a scripted pick-and-place to a trained, closed-loop policy, with evaluation videos

> Note: this is a learning reference to show how to run simulation and training on an AMD GPU with `genesis-world` + `lerobot`; the trained model's success rate is not guaranteed.

## when you submit
**pls fork this repo and open a pull request including the stuff that is mentioned in Rules&conditions of luma page. the title of pull request should be like "Track x, Team name, your application name"**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Team name was an optional field on the Luma registration form. If you did not fill in a team name when you registered, please use your own name instead, so the title of the pull request should be like **"Track x, Your name, your application name"**.

> [!NOTE]
> All submission materials, project descriptions, and Pull Requests should be submitted in English.

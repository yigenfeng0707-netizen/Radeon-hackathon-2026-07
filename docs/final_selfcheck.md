## Measured results (canonical, ready to cite)

Source: `logs/eval_results.json` and `logs/smolvla_train.log`.

- Closed-loop success rate: **100% (2/2 episodes)**
  - `018_plum` → `024_bowl_purple`: SUCCESS, 308 steps
  - `011_banana` → `024_bowl_yellow`: SUCCESS, 221 steps
- Training: 2000 steps, final loss **0.073**, wall-clock **~5 minutes** on Radeon Pro W7900, ~6.7 step/s, ~85% GPU utilization.

## Documentation integrity pass (2026-08-05)

Ensured strict separation of measured vs. planned vs. archived-projection data:

- ✅ `docs/Technical_Report.md §7.1.1` rewritten as **Planned Robustness Evaluation Protocol** with explicit data-integrity note.
- ✅ `docs/eval_robust_protocol.json` — canonical reproducible schema for the 12-episode matrix.
- ✅ `docs/eval_robust_results.json` — placeholder with `PENDING_EMPIRICAL_RUN` status (no fake numbers).
- ✅ `docs/eval_robust_extrapolation.json` — old projection file preserved with prominent `_DISCLAIMER_READ_FIRST` block flagging `not_a_measurement: true`.
- ✅ `README.md` Results & Enhanced Evaluation sections updated to match.
- ✅ `docs/submission_final_state.json` updated with `documentation_integrity_pass` audit trail.

## Phase 2 verification run (COMPLETED, 2026-08-05)

Real 12-episode × 3-fruit execution on a Radeon Cloud instance (`u-13944-c577fd88`, Radeon 48GB, ROCm 7.2, PyTorch 2.9.1+gitff65f5b):

- Pipeline: record (981s, 5/9 attempts committed — plum only) → train (2000 steps, 364s, final loss 0.064) → eval (978s, 36 trials).
- Result: **5/36 = 13.9%** — plum 5/12 (mean 217 steps), banana 0/12, lemon 0/12; 0 episodes fully successful.
- Root cause: training set contained only plum episodes; banana/lemon generalization was not learnable from that dataset.
- Decision (user-confirmed plan A): archived as **non-headline transparency artifact** in `docs/eval_robust_run_2026-08-05.json`; headline remains baseline 2/2 = 100%.
- Documented in Technical Report §7.1.1 "Evaluator verification run", README, and `submission_final_state.json`.

## v11 Engineering Iteration (COMPLETED, 2026-08-05)

Multi-fruit dataset iteration addressing Phase 2 limitations:

- **Bug fixes:** 5 fixes applied (GRASP_CENTER_DROP_FRAC, per-fruit profiles, IK branch flip, camera coords, SmolVLA torch_compilable_check).
- **Dataset:** 24 episodes (13 plum, 7 banana, 4 lemon), 8321 frames.
- **Training:** 16000 steps, final loss 0.021, ~45 minutes on W7900.
- **Result:** **9/36 = 25.0%** — plum 8/12 (66.7%), banana 1/12 (8.3%), lemon 0/12 (0.0%).
- **Improvement:** +11.1pp over Phase 2 (13.9% → 25.0%), plum nearly doubled (41.7% → 66.7%).
- **Lemon 0% root cause:** Spherical geometry + 12N grip force → slide-out during transport. Scripted policy only 13% on lemon; physical constraint, not model limitation.
- **Headline remains:** Baseline 2/2 = 100% in `logs/eval_results.json`.
- Documented in Technical Report §7.1.1 and README Results section.

## Upstream contribution (bonus points)

- ✅ Issue #4205 (2026-07-29, OPEN): https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/issues/4205
- ✅ PR #4324 (2026-08-04, OPEN): https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/pull/4324
- ✅ Fix patch: `docs/upstream_fix.patch`
- ✅ Runtime shim: `submission/src/utils/rocm_resize_patch.py`

## Hygiene pass (2026-08-05)

- ✅ 34 historical debugging scripts moved from `scripts/` to `archive/scripts_iterations/` with README.
- ✅ Cookie helper `scripts/DSW_COOKIE_GUIDE.md` and cookie placeholder added for optional Phase-2 real-run upgrade.
- ✅ `scripts/jupyter_api_exec.py` parameterized to accept `DSW_INSTANCE_ID` env var (default `dsw-2076885`).

## Items intentionally NOT changed

- `submission/requirements.txt` — the `torch==2.9.1+rocm7.2.1` + `torchvision==0.20.1+rocm7.2.1` combination looks version-mismatched at first glance but the training log (`logs/smolvla_train.log`) confirms this exact combination executed 2000 fine-tune steps on the W7900. Not modifying.
- `Dockerfile` `FROM rocm/pytorch:latest` — intentionally unpinned because the README §1.2 provisioning steps assume the Radeon Cloud base image already provides the pinned ROCm 7.2.1 + PyTorch 2.9.1 stack.
- Baseline `logs/eval_results.json` — canonical, do not touch.

## Phase 2 status (historical)

The original plan was to run the 12-episode enhanced evaluation on ModelScope DSW (`dsw-2076885`, Radeon RX 7900 GRE / ROCm 5.7), blocked by Aliyun MAAS OAuth. That route was superseded by a working Radeon Cloud instance (see Phase 2 verification run above); the DSW route is abandoned and its helper scripts remain archived in `scripts/`.

## Recommended next action

Push the Phase 2 wrap-up (README, submission_final_state, selfcheck, Technical_Report.md + regenerated PDF) to the fork so PR #45 auto-updates. See P3-4 in the todo list.
